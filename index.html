                    <h3>David Lockstein</h3>
                    <p>With over twenty years of experience as an IT Director and Technology Coordinator in K-12 education, the author has spent his career at the intersection of technology and learning. Throughout those two decades, he has guided schools and districts through wave after wave of technological change, always with one eye on what's next and the other on what's best for students.</p>
                    
                    <p>The inspiration for this book grew out of countless conversations with educators, both within his own district and across the state of Wisconsin, who were grappling with the same urgent questions: How do we stop AI? How do we control it? How do we keep students from cheating? After hearing these concerns repeated in hallways, conference rooms, and professional development sessions, he became convinced there had to be a better way to approach the conversation. There had to be another way to look at AI.</p>
                    
                    <p>A close follower of the industry's leading voices in artificial intelligence, he takes their insights seriously, especially their predictions about where AI is heading and how fast it's getting there. This book was written to bridge the gap between those visionary voices and the educators shaping the next generation. His hope is that by connecting these two worlds, students will ultimately be the ones who benefit.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you walk away from this book with even one new idea, one slightly different perspective, or a deeper understanding of how AI will shape the future, he considers that a win. He hopes you enjoy the book, and he'd love to hear from you, even if you don't. Open dialogue is what leads to new ideas and new perspectives.</p>
